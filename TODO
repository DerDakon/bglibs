- Make all the crypto hash functions plug into a common control block.
  - Data:
    - block size
    - compressed state size
    - digest size
  - Functions:
    - initialize(void* state)
    - compress(void* state, unsigned char* block)
    - extract digest(void* state)
  - All current hash functions use exactly the same finalization code:
    - hash 0x80
    - hash 0x00 until there are 64 bits left in the current block
    - hash the 64-bit number of bits originally hashed in MSB order
      (this will cause a final compression invocation).

- Rewrite all crypto hash code in terms of the above control block.

- Rewrite the IPv6 library to accept/handle IPv4-only connections
  transparently.
  - Use a prefix of ::4444/32 to distinguish from ::ffff/32 and ::0/32

* Add hooks for shared library building. *

- Rewrite iobuf and str number conversion routines to use fmt

- Add FP to fmt
  - float (32 bits) is 1+23 bits (8 bit exponent) (max 8 digits)
  - double (64 bits) is 1+52 bits (11 bit exponent) (max 16 digits)

- Finish DNS library!
  - Implement TCP queries

- Add make-compile, make-load, make-makelib scripts

- Add some way of dealing with dependancies like "socket.lib" etc.

- exec replacement?  http://cr.yp.to/lib/pathexec.html

- More ADTs: bag/set, tree

- Add tests to adt/queue, adt/stack
