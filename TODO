- Finish DNS library!
  - Implement TCP queries

- Make the CRC tables (and code even) generated at build time.
  - This will likely require that no external =x targets exist in
    subdirs, which in turn means separating the cvm library out.

- Add make-compile, make-load, make-makelib scripts

- Add library documentation

- Add some way of dealing with dependancies like "socket.lib" etc.

- exec replacement?  http://cr.yp.to/lib/pathexec.html

- More ADTs: bag/set, tree
