Changes in version 1.003

- Optimized path matching to only stat intermediate entries if they
  don't contain any meta-characters, instead of reading the entire
  directory and matching.
- Fixed a bug in str/cmp.c: it missed adding offset to the string
  pointer.
- Fixed bug in iobuf/[io]buf_seek.c -- seeks to the current read/write
  position should not cause an lseek syscall.
- The iobuf library now uses an anonymous mmap region for I/O instead of
  a malloced buffer, if possible.  Some OS's can optimize away a data
  copy using this kind of mechanism.

- Added a dict_foreach routine for iterating over the contents of a
  dictionary.

- Removed the silly trailing "." from the common message output code.
