-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.010

- Added a getpeereid sysdep function.

- Added some small optimizations to the SHA-256/512 code and fixed a
  one-off bug.

- Added some major optimizations to the SHA-1 update/final code.

- Removed the cvm libraries.

- All the CRC tables are now generated at build time.

- Split the case insensitive parts of the str_glob and str_match
  functions into str_case_glob and str_case_match respectively.

- wrap_* functions can now exit with a customized error code.

- Added str_start functions.

Changes in version 1.009

- Rewrite the SHA-256 and SHA-512 algorithms to make them work on both
  64-bit and MSB platforms, and added the SHA-384 algorithm.

- Fixed iobuf/iobuf_init.c for systems that lack anonymous mmap.

- Turn off recv/sendfd if the appropriate defines are missing.

Changes in version 1.008

- Added queue and stack ADT's.

- Added globbing function to the str library.

- Changed str_match functions to add case insensitivity.

- Added "function" options, and option separators to the CLI library, as
  well as enhancing the string list type.

- More portability fixes.

Changes in version 1.007

- Fixed bug in iobuf/iobuf_init.c -- parameters to mmap happened to work
  on Linux but were completely bogus for portability.

- Switched the 64-bit CRC function to use the polynomial specified in
  the DLT1 spec (ECMA-182).

- Added (count 'em) three 16-bit CRC functions -- ARC, CCITT, and XMODEM.

- Added generic number output routines to iobuf, and generic number
  appending routines to str.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.006

- Added uint16, uint32, and uint64 pack/unpack functions.

- Added 32 and 64 bit CRC functions, and the Mersenne Twister random
  number generator.

- Changed the ipv4addr typedef to make explicit when it's being passed
  by reference.  This breaks source code compatibility with previous
  versions.

- Major internal reorganization moving many files into subdirectories.

- More portability fixes.

- Started working on adding Doxygen documentation to the sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.005

- Portability fixes for *BSD (possibly others).

- #define MSG_NO_DEBUG before including <msg/msg.h> and no debugging
  messages will be compiled into the object code.

- Added long long str_cat*ll and obuf_put*ll functions.

- Added str_match simple pattern-matching function.

- Fixed the shadowed global variable naming conflicts.

- Flattened out and simplified the installed lib files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.003

- Optimized path matching to only stat intermediate entries if they
  don't contain any meta-characters, instead of reading the entire
  directory and matching.
- Fixed a bug in str/cmp.c: it missed adding offset to the string
  pointer.
- Fixed bug in iobuf/[io]buf_seek.c -- seeks to the current read/write
  position should not cause an lseek syscall.
- The iobuf library now uses an anonymous mmap region for I/O instead of
  a malloced buffer, if possible.  Some OS's can optimize away a data
  copy using this kind of mechanism.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.002

- Fixed bug in str_cat#s routines: they didn't increase the string
  length.

- Added crypto hash libraries (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512).

- Added a dict_foreach routine for iterating over the contents of a
  dictionary.

- Removed the silly trailing "." from the common message output code.

- Portability fixes for FreeBSD (and possibly others).

  from /usr/local/*/bglibs
- Added missing pwcmp/client include & library.
- Added missing uint32.h and uint64.h targets.
