Changes in version 1.021

- Fixed typo bug in str_catfv and str_copyfv that caused failures on (at
  least) PPC and S390 architectures.  Thanks Gerrit Pape.

- Fixed 32-to-64 bit sign extension bug in fmt_multi on some 64-bit
  platforms.  Thanks Gerrit Pape.

- installer/instcheck program libraries now optionally install into a
  prefix directory specified on the command line or with
  $install_prefix (which can be set on the make command line).

- Installation is now done under seperate include/lib directories.

- Added sysdep for "extern int daylight" (replaced by a macro if not
  present).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.020

- Fixed a couple of length counting bugs in the fmt number code.

- Added multiple-item formatting functions fmt_multi (similar to printf,
  but safer), fmt_multiv, obuf_putf, str_catf, and str_copyf, as well as
  a set of formatted message functions.

Note: As of this version, a C99-compatible compiler is required to build
the software.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.019

- Broke the iobuf includes into smaller parts.

- Added low-level fcntl wrapper functions: fcntl_{fd,fl}_{off,on}

- Added cloexec_{off,on} functions to manipulate the close-on-exec flag.

- Selfpipes now close-on-exec to prevent the pipe from being exported to
  child processes.

- Changed the error in ibuf_getnetstring from EPROTO to EPROTOTYPE to
  fix compile errors on *BSD systems.  Thanks Ville Walveranta.

Changes in version 1.018

- Added missing crypto/surf.h and unix/selfpipe.h headers to insthier.

- Added sysdep and emulator function for mkfifo.

- Added sysdep check for the "named pipe bug": polling a named pipe
  without a writer unconditionally succeeds.

- Fixed bug in ibuf_getu: didn't subtract ASCII '0' offset from digits.

- Added environment string manipulation functions.

- Added named pipe trigger functions.

- Added str_getnetstring function.

Changes in version 1.017

- Added SURF (Simple Unpredictable Random Function) from the algorithm
  described in http://cr.yp.to/papers/surf.ps

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.016

- Fixed socket_notcpdelay on FreeBSD 4.x (and possibly other BSDs).

- Added back the definition of socket_tcp and socket_udp, the omission
  of which broke linking with libraries compiled against older bglibs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.015

- Added a "libbg.a" build target, including all the other libraries that
  don't define a main routine (like cli).

- Added set of str_splice functions, to insert one string into another.

- Added IPv6 address parsing/formatting and network functions.

- Added a library of number formatting routines.

- Modifed str_subst to return a count of substitutions.

- Added str_xlate function.

- Added socket connect functions with a timeout.

- Added ibuf_readall, ibuf_openreadclose, ibuf_copytofd, and
  obuf_copyfromfd.

- Added resolve_ipv4name_n, to resolve a name to more than one IP.

- Rewrote the CRC routines in terms of "generic" forward and reflected
  functions.

- Added CRC32C (used in iSCSI) functions.

NOTE: The next non-bugfix version of bglibs will be rewritten to use the
new formatting routines in the appropriate iobuf and str functions.
This will require linking against additional libraries in the future, or
against the all-inclusive libbg.a.

- Fixed up crc64 table generation on 64-bit platforms.

- Fixed ipv4 address parsing number validation.

- Fixed crc table generation on Solaris caused by missing
  #include <stdlib.h>

  the root directory is non-readable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.010

- Added a getpeereid sysdep function.

- Added self-pipe SIGCHLD handling functions.

- Added some small optimizations to the SHA-256/512 code and fixed a
  one-off bug.

- Removed the cvm libraries.

- All the CRC tables are now generated at build time.

- Split the case insensitive parts of the str_glob and str_match
  functions into str_case_glob and str_case_match respectively.

- wrap_* functions can now exit with a customized error code.

- Added str_start functions.

- Fixed another installer bug, which caused the "installer.a" library to
  get installed as "instcheck.a"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.009

- Rewrite the SHA-256 and SHA-512 algorithms to make them work on both
  64-bit and MSB platforms, and added the SHA-384 algorithm.

Changes in version 1.008

- Added queue and stack ADT's.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.007

- Fixed bug in iobuf/iobuf_init.c -- parameters to mmap happened to work
  on Linux but were completely bogus for portability.

- Switched the 64-bit CRC function to use the polynomial specified in
  the DLT1 spec (ECMA-182).

- Added (count 'em) three 16-bit CRC functions -- ARC, CCITT, and XMODEM.

- Added generic number output routines to iobuf, and generic number
  appending routines to str.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.006

- Added uint16, uint32, and uint64 pack/unpack functions.

- Added 32 and 64 bit CRC functions, and the Mersenne Twister random
  number generator.

- Changed the ipv4addr typedef to make explicit when it's being passed
  by reference.  This breaks source code compatibility with previous
  versions.

- More portability fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.005

- Portability fixes for *BSD (possibly others).

  messages will be compiled into the object code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.003

- Optimized path matching to only stat intermediate entries if they
  don't contain any meta-characters, instead of reading the entire
  directory and matching.
- Fixed a bug in str/cmp.c: it missed adding offset to the string
  pointer.
- Fixed bug in iobuf/[io]buf_seek.c -- seeks to the current read/write
  position should not cause an lseek syscall.
- The iobuf library now uses an anonymous mmap region for I/O instead of
  a malloced buffer, if possible.  Some OS's can optimize away a data
  copy using this kind of mechanism.
