Idea: pre-parsed code
- Add a pre-parse command
- Write the pre-parsed code (repr(parser.parse(body))) to
  filename.something
- In parser.parse, look for the pre-parsed file and see if it's older
  than the normal file.  If so, parse as usual, otherwise load the
  pre-parsed file.
- According to the benchmark scripts I've written, pre-parsed code is
  3-4 times faster to load than the parsing process.  The big question
  is if this difference would be completely "lost in the noise".

Idea: convert the template into real Python code
- Similar to above concept
- Write out Python code to filename.py
- Compile to filename.pyc
